## Operating Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
### Who was the client?
The Gaming Room.

### What type of software did they want you to design?
We used Java to develop a game app software that would follow a client/server model, which could be used on different operating systems.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I learned to read everything on the assignment page carefully and more than twice when it comes to the requirements and which chapters to read in advance. This was very important in achieving great outcomes for the entire project.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The most helpful part of the Software Design Document was providing a description of the design system, which allowed me to fully understand what was being built and how it was expected to function.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick?
I would create at least one iteration of each document when revising the sections.

### How would you improve it?
By adding a different version number to each revised document, so I don't get confused when looking back at each version.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design?
The clients always know what they want to accomplish. Once I gather data on the best idea as the developer, I interpret and analyze that idea to the best of my abilities to implement it effectively.

### Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The client is very important to the developer and the whole team. Once we start, we want to get everything working correctly the first time around.

### How did you approach designing software?
By following a development process or a life cycle process until completion, ensuring the client is pleased with the final results of the software.

### What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Waterfall or Agile project management methods. Additionally, keeping up with the basic tools of project management: scheduling, time management, communication, finance, accounting, organizing, workflow, and planning.
